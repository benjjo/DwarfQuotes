Check if you have java installed by opening a command prompt and typing "java -version".
You should see something like the following:

C:\Users\Jon Snow>java -version
java version "1.8.0_251"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_251-b08)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.251-b08, mixed mode)
